# EGR221A-HW1 Brief Overview
This homework assignment was from a Data Structures course. The goal of this assignment was to finish implementing a keyboard version of Guitar Hero with some of the file provided.
The given file resources include the audio source, text files that included the information necessary to relate keyboard inputs to guitar notes, and standard libraries to read and transfer the data to the main files.

What was implemented was the GuitarLite, KPGuitarString, and Guitar37 which allowed the typed notes to be mapped to guitar sounds according to the specified oscillation and buffer.
Each note relied on the LinkedList data structure which acted as the buffer to construct the guitar string with the given frequency and energy rate.
